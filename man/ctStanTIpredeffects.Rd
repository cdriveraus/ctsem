\title{Get time independent predictor effect estimates}
\usage{
ctStanTIpredeffects(fit, probs = c(0.25, 0.5, 0.75), whichTIpreds = 1,
  whichpars = "all", plot = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{fit object from \code{\link{ctStanFit}}}

\item{probs}{numeric vector of quantile probabilities from 0 to 1. Specify 3
values if plotting, the 2nd will be drawn as a line with uncertainty polygon
based on 1st and 3rd.}

\item{whichTIpreds}{integer vector specifying which of the tipreds in the fit object you want to
use to calculate effects. Unless quadratic / higher order versions of predictors have been 
included, selecting more than one probably doesn't make sense. If for instance a squared
predictor has been included, then you can specify both the linear and squared version. 
The x axis of the plot (if generated) will be based off the first indexed predictor. To 
check what predictors are in the model, run \code{fit$ctstanmodel$TIpredNames}.}

\item{whichpars}{Integer vector specifying Which of the individually varying subject
level parameters to compute effects on. 
'auto' uses all available, which is equivalent to 
\code{1:sum(fit$ctstanmodel$pars$indvarying)}.
The integer corresponding to specific parameters can be found as follows, replacing \code{fit} as appropriate:
\code{fit$ctstanmodel$pars[sf$ctstanmodel$pars$indvarying,'param']}.}

\item{plot}{Logical. If TRUE, nothing is returned but instead \code{\link{ctPlotArray}}
is used to plot the output instead.}

\item{...}{arguments to pass to \code{\link{ctPlotArray}} for plotting.}
}
\value{
Either a three dimensional array of predictor effects, or nothing with a plot
generated.
}
\description{
COmputes and plots combined effects and quantiles for effects of time independent predictors
on subject level parameters of a ctStanFit object.
