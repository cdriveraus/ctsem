  abstract = {In this paper, we consider two basic aspects of demand analysis, with application to the demand for natural gas in the residential and commercial market. The more fundamental one consists in the formulation of a demand function for commodities--such as natural gas--whose consumption is technologically related to the stock of appliances. We believe that in such markets, the behavior of the consumer can be described best in terms of a dynamic mechanism. Related to this is the more specific problem of estimating the parameters of the demand function, when the demand model is cast in dynamic terms and when observations are drawn from a time series of cross sections. Accordingly, this paper is centered around these two major themes, although, as the title suggests, the emphasis is placed on the second one. In Section 1, we present the theoretical formulation of the dynamic model for gas. In Section 2, the results of the estimation of the gas model by ordinary least squares methods are presented. These results, together with more fundamental theoretical considerations, suggest a different approach. The essence of this approach, which is not restricted to the gas model, is discussed in Section 3, while two alternative procedures for estimating the coefficients of the dynamic model in the light of this new approach are proposed in Section 4. It is subsequently shown that the application of these procedures to the gas data produces results that are reasonable on the basis of a priori theoretical considerations.},

  abstract = {Fixed- and random-effects models for longitudinal data are common in sociology. Their primary advantage is that they control for time-invariant omitted variables. However, analysts face several issues when they employ these models. One is the choice of which to apply; another is that FEM and REM models as usually implemented might be insufficiently flexible. For example, the effects of variables, including the latent time-invariant variable, might change over time. The latent time-invariant variable might correlate with some variables and not others. Lagged endogenous variables might be necessary. Alternatives that move beyond the classic FEM and REM models are known, but they involve estimators and software that make these extended models difficult to implement and to compare. This article presents a general panel model that includes the standard FEM and REM as special cases. In addition, it provides a sequence of nested models that provide a richer range of models that researchers can easily compare with likelihood ratio tests and fit statistics. Furthermore, researchers can implement our general panel model and its special cases in widely available structural equation models software.},

Most dynamic models (e.g., cross-lagged panel models) in the social and behavioural sciences are discrete time models. An assumption of discrete time models is that time intervals between measurements are equal, and that all subjects were assessed at the same intervals. Violations of this assumption are often ignored due to the difficulty of accounting for varying time intervals, therefore parameter estimates can be biased and the time course of effects becomes ambiguous. By using stochastic differential equations to estimate an underlying continuous process, continuous time models allow for any pattern of measurement occasions. By interfacing to OpenMx, ctsem combines the flexible specification of structural equation models with the enhanced data gathering opportunities and improved estimation of continuous time models. ctsem can estimate relationships over time for multiple latent processes, measured by multiple noisy indicators with varying time intervals between observations. Within and between effects are estimated simultaneously by modeling both observed covariates and unobserved heterogeneity. Exogenous shocks with different shapes, group differences, higher order diffusion effects and oscillating processes can all be simply modeled. We first introduce and define continuous time models, then show how to specify and estimate a range of continuous time models using ctsem.},

The distinguishing feature of state space time series models is that observations are regarded as made up of distinct components such as trend, seasonal, regression elements and disturbance terms, each of which is modelled separately. The techniques that emerge from this approach are very flexible and are capable of handling a much wider range of problems than the main analytical system currently in use for time series analysis, the Box-Jenkins ARIMA system. Additions to this second edition include the filtering of nonlinear and non-Gaussian series. Part I of the book obtains the mean and variance of the state, of a variable intended to measure the effect of an interaction and of regression coefficients, in terms of the observations. Part II extends the treatment to nonlinear and non-normal models. For these, analytical solutions are not available so methods are based on simulation.},

Due to basic limitations of cross-sectional designs and a reluctance to disentangle antecedent--consequent relations in longitudinal designs, the functional significance and dynamics of these links have remained unclear. Advanced structural equation models allow representing multivariate longitudinal changes as a function of time-based and directed relations. We applied this methodology to longitudinal data from the Berlin Aging Study (at inception total N = 516; age range = 70--103 years) to explore the structural dynamics among perceptual speed, verbal knowledge, close visual acuity, and distance visual acuity. We found reliable, occasion-based, age-partialed latent regression paths that influence longitudinal changes within and across intellectual and sensory domains. We conclude that intellectual and sensory domains are dynamically linked in old and very old age, and discuss implications of this finding for theories of cognitive aging.},

  abstract = {SummaryBackground Routine infant immunisation with seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) began in the USA in 2000. Although invasive pneumococcal disease has declined substantially, the programme's effect on hospital admissions for pneumonia is unknown. We therefore assessed the effect of the programme on rates of all-cause and pneumococcal pneumonia admissions. Methods Data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample, the largest inpatient database available in the USA, were analysed with an interrupted time-series analysis that used pneumonia (all-cause and pneumococcal) admission rates as the main outcomes. Monthly admission rates estimated for years after the introduction of PCV7 vaccination (2001--2004) were compared with expected rates calculated from pre-PCV7 years (1997--1999). The year of vaccine introduction (2000) was excluded, and rates of admission for dehydration were assessed for comparison. Findings At the end of 2004, all-cause pneumonia admission rates had declined by 39\% (95\% CI 22--52) for children younger than 2 years, who were the target population of the vaccination programme. This annual decline in all-cause pneumonia admissions of 506 (291--675) per 100\hphantom{,}000 children younger than 2 years represented about 41\hphantom{,}000 pneumonia admissions prevented in 2004. During the 8 study years, 10\hphantom{,}659 (2\%) children younger than 2 years admitted with pneumonia were coded as having pneumococcal disease; these rates declined by 65\% (47--77). This decline represented about 17 fewer admissions per 100\hphantom{,}000 children in 2004. Admission rates for dehydration for children younger than 2 years remained stable over the study period. Interpretation The reduction in all-cause pneumonia admissions in children younger than 2 years provides an estimate of the proportion of childhood pneumonias attributable to Streptococcus pneumoniae in the USA that are vaccine preventable. Our results contribute to the growing body of evidence supporting the beneficial effects of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in children.},

Aims To test the public health impact of the escalating sales of antidepressants. Method Nationwide data from Iceland are used as an example to study the effect of sales of antidepressants on suicide, disability, hospital admissions and out-patient visits. Results Sales of antidepressants increased from 8.4 daily defined doses per 1000 inhabitants per day in 1975 to 72.7 in 2000, which is a user prevalence of 8.7\% for the adult population. Suicide rates fluctuated during 1950--2000 but did not show any definite trend. Rates for out-patient visits increased slightly over the period 1989--2000 and admission rates increased even more. The prevalence of disability due to depressive and anxiety disorders has notdecreased over the past 25 years. Conclusions The dramatic increase in the sales of antidepressants has not had any marked impact on the selected public health measures. Obviously, better treatment for depressive disorders is still needed in order to reduce the burden caused by them.},

We used 10-wave interview data of 503 boys, their primary caregivers, and their teachers. Our first aim was to unravel the direction of effects between parent--child relationships and children's offending. Cross-lagged panel models revealed bidirectional links over time between poorer quality parent--child relationships and boys' offending across late childhood (age 7--10), early adolescence (age 10--13) and middle adolescence (age 13--16). Second, we examined the associations between mean changes in delinquency, on the one hand, and mean changes in relationship quality, on the other hand. Although parent--child relationships improved during childhood, their quality decreased in early adolescence and remained stable in middle adolescence. Delinquency increased only in middle adolescence. In five out of six models, the slope factors of relationship quality and offending were strongly correlated, indicating that stronger increases in delinquency were associated with stronger decreases in parent--child relationship quality across childhood, early adolescence, and middle adolescence. The discussion focuses on the theoretical implications of these two types of longitudinal associations.},

In such an analysis an explicit account should be taken of the statistical dependence that exists between the quantitative variables and the effects. It is shown that when this is done, the random effect approach and the fixed effect approach yield the same estimate for the slopes, the "within" estimate. Any matrix combination of the "within" and "between" estimates is generally biased. When the "within" estimate is subject to a relatively large error a minimum mean square error can be applied, as is generally done in regression analysis. Such an estimator is developed here from a somewhat different point of departure.},

  abstract = {The end result of a study described here was to improve the Dutch pupil monitoring system LISKAL, which previously only enabled teachers to evaluate decoding and reading comprehension abilities of individual students at two discrete time points each year. A continuous time state space model was developed which enables the teacher to evaluate the pupil's progress continuously as well as at fixed points. Maximum likelihood parameter estimation of the continuous time linear stochastic state space model is considered on the basis of large N discrete time data using a structural equation modeling (SEM) program. Random subject effects are allowed to be part of the model. The exact discrete model (EDM) is employed which links the discrete time model parameters to the underlying continuous time model parameters by means of nonlinear restrictions. The EDM is generalized to cover not only time-invariant parameters but also the cases of stepwise time-varying (piecewise time-invariant) parameters and parameters varying continuously over time according to a general polynomial scheme. The identification of the continuous time parameters is discussed and an educational example (with 638 Dutch first and second graders) is presented.

Understanding of procedures for estimating random effects should help people to understand some complicated and controversial issues about fixed and random effects models and also help to bridge the apparent gulf between the Bayesian and Classical schools of thought.},

  abstract = {Recently, R. D. Stoel, F. G. Garre, C. Dolan, and G. van den Wittenboer (2006) reviewed approaches for obtaining reference mixture distributions for difference tests when a parameter is on the boundary. The authors of the present study argue that this methodology is incomplete without a discussion of when the mixtures are needed and show that they only become relevant when constrained difference tests are conducted. Because constrained difference tests can hide important model misspecification, a reliable way to assess global model fit under constrained estimation would be needed. Examination of the options for assessing model fit under constrained estimation reveals that no perfect solutions exist, although the conditional approach of releasing a degree of freedom for each active constraint appears to be the most methodologically sound one. The authors discuss pros and cons of constrained and unconstrained estimation and their implementation in 5 popular structural equation modeling packages and argue that unconstrained estimation is a simpler method that is also more informative about sources of misfit. In practice, researchers will have trouble conducting constrained difference tests appropriately, as this requires a commitment to ignore Heywood cases. Consequently, mixture distributions for difference tests are rarely appropriate.},

  abstract = {Panel data are modeled as dynamic structural equations in continuous time t (stochastic differential equations). The continuously moving latent state vector y(t) is mapped to an observable discrete time series (or panel) zni =zn(ti) with the help of a measurement equation including errors of measurement (continuous-discrete state space model). Therefore the approach is able to handle data with irregularly observed waves, missing values and arbitrarily interpolated exogenous influences (control variables). In order to model development and growth models, the system parameter matrices are assumed to be time dependent. it is shown how the likelihood function can be computed in this general linear setting by using a Kalman filter algorithm. The estimation method is tested in a simulation study using a bivariate growth model and applied to the Brownian bridge.},

  abstract = {[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 17(3) of Psychological Methods (see record 2012-24038-005). The supplemental materials link was missing. All versions of this article have been corrected.] Panel studies, in which the same subjects are repeatedly observed at multiple time points, are among the most popular longitudinal designs in psychology. Meanwhile, there exists a wide range of different methods to analyze such data, with autoregressive and cross-lagged models being 2 of the most well known representatives. Unfortunately, in these models time is only considered implicitly, making it difficult to account for unequally spaced measurement occasions or to compare parameter estimates across studies that are based on different time intervals. Stochastic differential equations offer a solution to this problem by relating the discrete time model to its underlying model in continuous time. It is the goal of the present article to introduce this approach to a broader psychological audience. A step-by-step review of the relationship between discrete and continuous time modeling is provided, and we demonstrate how continuous time parameters can be obtained via structural equation modeling. An empirical example on the relationship between authoritarianism and anomia is used to illustrate the approach. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {When designing longitudinal studies, researchers often aim at equal intervals. In practice, however, this goal is hardly ever met, with different time intervals between assessment waves and different time intervals between individuals being more the rule than the exception. One of the reasons for the introduction of continuous time models by means of structural equation modelling has been to deal with irregularly spaced assessment waves (e.g., Oud \& Delsing, 2010). In the present paper we extend the approach to individually varying time intervals for oscillating and non-oscillating processes. In addition, we show not only that equal intervals are unnecessary but also that it can be advantageous to use unequal sampling intervals, in particular when the sampling rate is low. Two examples are provided to support our arguments. In the first example we compare a continuous time model of a bivariate coupled process with varying time intervals to a standard discrete time model to illustrate the importance of accounting for the exact time intervals. In the second example the effect of different sampling intervals on estimating a damped linear oscillator is investigated by means of a Monte Carlo simulation. We conclude that it is important to account for individually varying time intervals, and encourage researchers to conceive of longitudinal studies with different time intervals within and between individuals as an opportunity rather than a problem.},
