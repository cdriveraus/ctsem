Features:
- Hierarchical Bayesian modeling using Stan, see ctStanFit function and 
  the vignette at 

Changes:
- Defaults change: Fix CINT to 0 and free MANIFESTMEANS

    fitting problems - try MANIFESTTRAITVAR instead if problematic!)

Features added:
- now with a change log!
- ctCompareExpectation plots expected means and covariances against model implied.
