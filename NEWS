ctsem news:

1/2/2017
#### 2.2.0 ####
Changes:
- Default to 0 covariance between time dependent predictors and initial (T0) 
  latents / traits / time independent predictors. Specify matrix as 'free' 
  in ctModel to estimate instead.

Fixes:
- Improve optimization approach for ctStanFit



6/1/2017
#### 2.1.1 ####
Improvements:
- improved fitting of frequentist models with ctFit and ctRefineTo, due to
  changes to carefulFit penalisation and refining approach.

Changes:
- Removed package 'PSM' from suggests field and vignette as requested by CRAN

Fixes:
- rstan 2.14 caused problems with data import for ctStanFit
- eliminated spurious warnings for ctStanFit


20/12/2016
#### 2.1.0 ####
Features:
- Empirical Bayes, experimental but can now optimize with hierarchical model 
  (when using the Kalman filter, as per defaults)
- Easy extraction and plotting of time independent predictor (covariate) effects,
  see ctStanTIpredEffects for example.
- Added stationary argument to ctStanFit - much more efficient than setting 
  priors on stationarity.

Bugs fixed:
- incorrect number of cores spawned for parallel sessions.
- optimize and variational bayes switches for ctStanFit did not work.
- ctKalman would break if only 1 row of data passed in.


18/11/2016
#### 2.0.0 ####
Features:
- Hierarchical Bayesian modeling using Stan, see ctStanFit function and 
  the vignette at https://cran.r-project.org/package=ctsem/vignettes/hierarchical.pdf

Changes:
- Defaults change: Fix CINT to 0 and free MANIFESTMEANS
- Reintroduce variable effect of TRAITVAR at T0 (more flexible but more 
    fitting problems - try MANIFESTTRAITVAR instead if problematic, or 
    use step-wise fitting approach, automated with ctRefineTo)


#### ctsem 1.1.6 ####
Features added:
- now with a change log!
- ctCompareExpectation plots expected means and covariances against model implied.
- remove log transform of drift matrix diagonal, positive drift diagonals again possible.
- ctRefineTo allows easy step wise fitting from simple to complex - faster and more robust fitting in many cases.
- ctPlot is a new function that allows more customization of plots.
- ctModel now allows time varying means to be specified.

Bugs fixed:
- corrected handling of Cholesky inputs for ctGenerate
