ctsem news:

Known bugs / limitations:
- Duplicated parameter names in a model may in certain cases generate compilation errors.

1/2/2017
#### 2.2.0 ####
Changes:
- Time dependent predictors now have instantaneous effect in both frequentist and 
  Bayesian approaches, and the documentation is updated to reflect this.
  Previously, no TDpreds affecting first time point in frequentist.
  Accordingly, wide data structure is accordingly different, with an extra column 
  per predictor and predictors now sorted by time point as for indicators. 
  See vignette for example. 
- Default to 0 covariance between time dependent predictors and initial (T0) 
  latents / traits / time independent predictors. Specify matrix as 'free' 
  in ctModel to estimate instead.
- Default carefulFit = TRUE for multiple groups frequentist models (ctMultigroupFit)
- Improve optimization approach for ctStanFit - but still not reliable for random effects.

Fixes:
- Multiple time dependent predictors with multiple processes resulted in inaccurate
  estimates for TDPREDEFFECT in frequentist approach of previous versions.
- Prevent ctGenerate from auto-filling matrices to 0 variance.
- Correct oscillating example for change in tolerance in OpenMx.


6/1/2017
#### 2.1.1 ####
Improvements:
- improved fitting of frequentist models with ctFit and ctRefineTo, due to
  changes to carefulFit penalisation and refining approach.

Changes:
- Removed package 'PSM' from suggests field and vignette as requested by CRAN

Fixes:
- rstan 2.14 caused problems with data import for ctStanFit
- eliminated spurious warnings for ctStanFit


20/12/2016
#### 2.1.0 ####
Features:
- Empirical Bayes, experimental but can now optimize with hierarchical model 
  (when using the Kalman filter, as per defaults)
- Easy extraction and plotting of time independent predictor (covariate) effects,
  see ctStanTIpredEffects for example.
- Added stationary argument to ctStanFit - much more efficient than setting 
  priors on stationarity.

Bugs fixed:
- incorrect number of cores spawned for parallel sessions.
- optimize and variational bayes switches for ctStanFit did not work.
- ctKalman would break if only 1 row of data passed in.


18/11/2016
#### 2.0.0 ####
Features:
- Hierarchical Bayesian modeling using Stan, see ctStanFit function and 
  the vignette at https://cran.r-project.org/package=ctsem/vignettes/hierarchical.pdf

Changes:
- Defaults change: Fix CINT to 0 and free MANIFESTMEANS
- Reintroduce variable effect of TRAITVAR at T0 (more flexible but more 
    fitting problems - try MANIFESTTRAITVAR instead if problematic, or 
    use step-wise fitting approach, automated with ctRefineTo)


#### ctsem 1.1.6 ####
Features added:
- now with a change log!
- ctCompareExpectation plots expected means and covariances against model implied.
- remove log transform of drift matrix diagonal, positive drift diagonals again possible.
- ctRefineTo allows easy step wise fitting from simple to complex - faster and more robust fitting in many cases.
- ctPlot is a new function that allows more customization of plots.
- ctModel now allows time varying means to be specified.

Bugs fixed:
- corrected handling of Cholesky inputs for ctGenerate
