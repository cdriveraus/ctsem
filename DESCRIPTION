Description: A multivariate continuous (and discrete) time dynamic modelling
    package for panel and time series data, using linear stochastic differential
    equations. Contains a faster frequentist set of functions using OpenMx for
    single subject and mixed-effects (random intercepts only) structural
    equation models, or a hierarchical Bayesian implementation using Stan that
    allows for random effects over all model parameters. Allows for modelling of
    multiple noisy measurements of multiple stochastic processes, time varying
    input / event covariates, and time invariant covariates used to predict the
    parameters.
